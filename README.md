# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles, separated out into two branches for my personal and work devices.

I followed the guide from here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles.

# Major features

## Karabiner-Elements
* Remap capslock to Ctrl/Esc (depending on my mood)
* Complex modification for Shift+Shift to enable/disable capslock
* Complex modification to change escape key to tilde when used with left_gui or left_control 

## Oh My Zsh and zshrc
* Because my dotfiles alias relies on having a different working directory, the oh-my-zsh git plugin doesn't detect which branch it's on for the custom prompt.
    * To fix

## Vim
